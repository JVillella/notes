> Take how we pay for things online. On Web 2.0, you are not empowered to make payments per se. In reality, you must contact your financial institution to do it on your behalf.

If you wish to contact your friend online, then likely you will need to appeal to Facebook to relay your message. ~[Why We Need Web 3.0](https://gavofyork.medium.com/why-we-need-web-3-0-5da4f2bf95ab)
