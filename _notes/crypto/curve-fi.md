- DEX running on Ethereum
- Designed for swapping (directly) between stablecoins so as to reduce slippage as is the case w/ Uniswap (e.g. 500 USDC = 494.32 DAI)
- ["[[uniswap]] for stablecoins"](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-curve-finance-in-defi) as it can be extremely useful for swapping between tokens that remain in a relatively similar price range (e.g. stablecoins or wrapped tokens like WBTC, renBTC, etc.)

## Liquidity Pools (LP) in Curve

A liquidity pool is a smart contract holding pools of tokens (e.g. DAI and USDC) w/ a set ratio between the two (e.g. 1:1). If a trader comes and exchanges one for the other, the pool would become unbalanced forcing the exchange fee to go up (e.g. according to the AMM formula).[^1]

LP recieve high APR because the pools are supplied to Compound to generate interest in combination to the fees when people trade.

### How it Works

1. Deposit coin (e.g. 100 USDC)
2. Coin gets split up according to the reserves, so now you have 4 DAI, 30 USDC, etc. You'd get a bonus depositing the smallest reserve currency (i.e. DAI in this example) or withdrawing the largest currency (e.g. USDC in this example)
   ```
   DAI: 300k (4%)
   USDC: 2M (30%)
   ...
   ```
