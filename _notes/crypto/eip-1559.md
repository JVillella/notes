**Motivation**

Move away from auction to address extreme volatility in gas prices (among other compelling motivations).

**Variables**

- `baseFeePerGas`: Comes from protocol via the previous block's header. Mandatory to pay this. This part of the fee gets burned (`gasUsed` \* `baseFeePerGas`).
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: User sets; additional fee that goes directly to miner to prioritize the transaction.
- `maxFeePerGas`: User sets; the max amount a user is willing to pay for the tx (combines `baseFeePerGas` and `maxPriorityFeePerGas`)

```
burned:   tx.baseFeePerGas * gasUsed
miner:    tx.maxPriorityFeePerGas * gasUsed
returned: tx.maxFeePerGas * gasUsed
    - (tx.baseFeePerGas + tx.maxPriorityFeePerGas) * gasUsed
```

**`baseFeePerGas` Calculation**

```
gas_used = prev_block.gas_used
gas_target = prev_block.gas_limit / 2
base_fee = prev_block.base_fee_per_gas

def calc_base_fee(gas_used, gas_target, base_fee):
  first block?
      return 1000000000
  gas_used == gas_target
      return gas_target
  gas_used > gas_target
      delta = gas_used - gas_target
      return base_fee + (base_fee * delta / gas_target / 8)
  gas_used < gas_target
      delta = gas_target - gas_used
      return base_fee + (base_fee * delta / gas_target / 8)
```

Summary,

- If used 50% of previous block gas limit, don't change next block base fee
- Otherwise, bring the base fee up or down relative to match 50% of previous block gas limit (max movement is 12.5%)

**Transaction Ordering**

> It is recommended that transactions with the same priority fee be sorted by time the transaction was received to protect the network from spamming attacks where the attacker throws a bunch of transactions into the pending pool in order to ensure that at least one lands in a favorable position. Miners should still prefer higher gas premium transactions over those with a lower gas premium, purely from a selfish mining perspective.

**Questions**

- Why doesn't the priority fee revert back into a blind auction?
