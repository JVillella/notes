# Polkadot

* Project from Gavin Wood, CTO of Ethereum for a period of time
* Uses PoS
* Uses additional blockchains: "parachains" (for longer-term projects; limited slots) and "parathreads" (more widely available) that plug into the main chain ("relay chain")
* Only 100 parachain slots, chosen via an auction (happening in April?)
