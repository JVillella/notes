# Scaling

>All blockchain protocols each node stores the entire state (account balances, contract code and storage, etc.) and processes all transactions. This provides a large amount of security, but greatly limits scalability: **a blockchain cannot process more transactions than a single node can**. In large part because of this, Bitcoin is limited to ~3–7 transactions per second, Ethereum to 7–15, etc.

## Methods of Scaling

- [[layer-2-scaling]]

## Musings

- Do layer-1 and layer-2 techniques remove ACID gaurentees?
