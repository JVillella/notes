# Ethereum 2: Sharding

Sharding aims to solve the scalability trilemma (Scalability, Decentralization, Security). It works by splitting up the verification job amongst randomly selected validators that form their own committee. A validator publishes a signature attesting that they did their job, and the other validators verify this signature (e.g. via [BLS signature aggregation](https://ethresear.ch/t/pragmatic-signature-aggregation-with-bls/2105)). This way instead of 10k validators each verifying 100 blocks, they're mining a few blocks in each committee and verifying the signatures of the 10k validators.

Blocks are broadcast on subnets instead of p2p to all validators. In Big O Notation, the sharded chain's capacity is O(C^2), growing quadratically (aka quadratic sharding).

We want to have a sharding solution that avoids 51% trust assumptions for validation. Validation problem is two parts: validating computation, and validating data availability. The former relies on either [[fraud-proofs]] or [[zk-snarks]]. The data availability problem (i.e. "how do you check that 1 MB of data is available without actually trying to download it?") can be solved via [[data-availability-sampling]] which makes it feasible to run data availability checking on every block.

>In the case of Ethereum sharding, the near-term plan is to make sharded blocks data-only; that is, the shards are purely a "data availability engine", and it's the job of layer-2 rollups to use that secure data space, plus either fraud proofs or ZK-SNARKs, to implement high-throughput secure transaction processing capabilities. However, it's completely possible to create such a built-in system to add "native" high-throughput execution.

**Shard Chains**

* 64 shard chains that users post transactions to
* When a validator successfully proposes a block in a given slot it gets referenced in the beacon chain via a "crosslink" (a signature signed by the committee). Every shard block creates a [crosslink](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/HkiULaluS)
