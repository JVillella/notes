* [(Old) State of Ethereum Protocol #2: The Beacon Chain](https://media.consensys.net/state-of-ethereum-protocol-2-the-beacon-chain-c6b6a9a69129)

**Beacon Chain**

* Central chain everyone stores, downloads, and verifies
* Stores,
  * consensus-critical information (eg. who the validators are, rewards and penalties assigned to them, deposits and withdrawals)
  * pointers (hashes) to shard chain blocks and shard state

**Validators**

* Must deposit 32 ETH into an account (either via eth1 or a shard chain) to become a validator
* Validators on the beacon chain attest what they believe to be the head block
  * When sharding is available they also include a hash of the correct shard block proposed by their committee
  * When sharding is available validators are grouped up into committees ([[128, 5000] validators each](https://bisontrails.co/eth2/committee/))
* Roughly speaking, if 2/3 of active validators sign an attestation supporting a block, that block becomes finalized (not revertable)
* Validators are rewarded for correct attestations, penalized for missing or wrong attestations, and slashed for double conflicting votes
* The random selection of a validator for block proposal is via RANDAO

**Slashing**

* A slashed validator,
  1. suffers a penalty of 3-100% of their deposit
  2. is forcibly ejected from the validator set
  3. has their coins forcibly locked for an additional 4 eeks before they can withdraw

**Time**

>The Beacon Chain provides the heartbeat to Ethereum 2.0. It provides the tempo and rhythm for the systemâ€™s harmony and consensus. Each slot is 12 seconds and an epoch is 32 slots: 6.4 minutes.
