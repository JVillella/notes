# Instability Without Block Rewards

**Resources**

[Paper: On the Instability of Bitcoin Without the Block Reward](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/mining_CCS.pdf)

**Problem**

Assume the longest chain head has 100 units of tx fees, and the next block is 5 units. Instead of mining the next block to grab the 5 units. A elfish miner would split the previous chain head in half, claim 55 units for themselves, and give 50 units for the next miner.
